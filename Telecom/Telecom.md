## Open Source Telecom Projects & Foundations 

These websites host collaborative projects for developing open source software in the telecom space, often implementing the standards set by SDOs. 

* Linux Foundation Networking (LFN): Hosts numerous open source projects vital to network automation and NFV, including:
  * ONAP (Open Network Automation Platform): A comprehensive framework for the automation and orchestration of network services.
  * Nephio: Focuses on cloud-native automation and Kubernetes-based deployment of network functions.
  * OpenDaylight (ODL): A modular open source SDN controller platform.
* OpenInfra Foundation: Supports open source infrastructure software, notably:
  * OpenStack: Widely used by telcos as a Virtual Infrastructure Manager (VIM) for Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) deployments.
  * StarlingX: A complete edge cloud computing infrastructure software stack used in O-RAN deployments.
* Open Networking Foundation (ONF): Merged operations with the Linux Foundation and supports projects like Aether and SEBA for open broadband networks.
* free5GC: An open source implementation of the 5G mobile core network (5GC).
* O-RAN Alliance: In collaboration with LFN, the O-RAN Software Community develops software for the Radio Access Network (RAN).

## Government & Regulatory Bodies

These websites provide information on policies, regulations, and research initiatives.
