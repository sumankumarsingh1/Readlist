Welcome !
In this scenario, we'll learn how to build a custom nginx image with Docker, push it to a container registry, and use it with Kubernetes.

ENJOY!

Pull images and create index.html
Pull the nginx image from Dockerhub with the command docker pull nginx:latest

List the images on your system with the command docker images

Create a file named "index.html" and open it in the vim text editor: vim index.html

Copy and paste the contents from here: azurek8s.com/custom-nginx

Save and quit! (:wq )
