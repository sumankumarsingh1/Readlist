## Number System
A number system is a system for representing numbers.

The value of any digit in a number can be determined by a digit, it's position in the number, and the base of the number system.

For example:
123 with a base 10
can also be written as 123<sub>10<sub>

Now let us look at the number position, the base to the power of position

| Number | Position |Base<sup>position<sup> |Position Value (PV) | Number Value= PV * Number |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|3|0|10<sup>0<sup>|1|3|
|2|1|10<sup>1<sup>|10|20|
|1|2|10<sup>2<sup>|100|100|

Total Value= 3 + 20 + 100 = 123



| System | Base | Symbols |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Decimal | 10 | 0 to 9 |
| Binary | 2 | 0 to 1 |
| Octal | 8 | 0 to 7 |
| Hexa Decimal | 16 | 0 to 9, A to F |
